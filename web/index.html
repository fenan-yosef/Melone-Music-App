    If you are serving your web app in a path other than the root, change the
    href value below to reflect the base path you are serving from.

    The path provided below has to start and end with a slash "/" in order for
    it to work correctly.

  /// Applies any pending focus changes and notifies listeners that the focus
  /// has changed.
  ///
  /// Must not be called during the build phase. This method is meant to be
  /// called in a post-frame callback or microtask when the pending focus
  /// changes need to be resolved before something else occurs.
  ///
  /// It can't be called during the build phase because not all listeners are
  /// safe to be called with an update during a build.

    This is a placeholder for base href that will be replaced by the value of
    the `--base-href` argument provided to `flutter build`.
